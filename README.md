I'm trying to learn [Figma](figma.com), so was just playing around and made a design, to which I converted into HTML, CSS code.


# Tools Used

[Figma](figma.com) - to make the design of the website.

[Dall.E 2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) - to generate the image of the Dolphin Man.

[Builder.io](builder.io) - to convert Figma design into HTML, CSS, JS code.
